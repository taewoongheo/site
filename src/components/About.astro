    Hello, I’m <code>tw.heo</code>, a creator who shapes sensation through
    technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m fascinated by building experiences that draw people into immersion and
    flow. I love transforming ordinary moments into new forms of interaction —
    moments where people naturally focus and lose themselves in the experience.
  </p>
  <p>I have three core goals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><mark>To evoke new sensations from the ordinary</mark></li>
    <li><mark>To build flow beyond technical boundaries</mark></li>
    <li><mark>To live as a flexible creator</mark></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Currently, I’m exploring interactive experiences through frontend
    engineering. In the future, I plan to experiment with AR/VR and content
    creation, using any tool that can inspire focus and emotional engagement.
